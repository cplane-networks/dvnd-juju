# Overview

The ORACLE charm is required for the Cplane controller which is an SDN orchestration system for the CPLANE DVNd OpenStack Neutron Solution.   All the information regarding the OVS, tenants and networks are stored in the Oracle Database.  

CPLANE's software-only solution automates creation of WAN and LAN network services with a highly intelligent SDN platform. Through advanced discovery, modeling and service orchestration, CPLANE automates not only the low-level infrastructure configuration and management of data center and wide area networks, but also the higher-level, value-add functions such as network virtualization, routing, policy and QoS.   CPLANE delivers network services faster and more reliably on existing network infrastructure. Since CPLANE is a software-only solution with no vendor-specific dependencies, it offers the added advantage of providing a
path to new network architectures and technologies, and away from vendor lock-in.
