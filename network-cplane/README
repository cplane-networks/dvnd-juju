# Overview

This charm provides the Cplane neutron plugin for OpenStack clouds.

CPLANE's software-only solution automates creation of WAN and LAN network services with a highly intelligent SDN platform. Through advanced discovery, modeling and service orchestration, CPLANE automates not only the low-level infrastructure configuration and management of data center and wide area networks, but also the higher-level, value-add functions such as network virtualization, routing, policy and QoS.   CPLANE delivers network services faster and more reliably on existing network infrastructure. Since CPLANE is a software-only solution with no vendor-specific dependencies, it offers the added advantage of providing a path to new network architectures and technologies, and away from vendor lock-in.

CPlane is an extremely lightweight Neutron plugin for Openstack

# Usage

This charm is subordinate to the **neutron-api** charm.  It also requires the deployment of the **neutron-openvswitch-cplane** charm which is again a subordinate to **nova-compute** charm and the **cplane-controller ** charm. It eliminates the need of the neutron-gateway charm as L3 routing agent since this is now handled by the compute tier.

The neutron-api-cplane charm has several core functions:

 - Install CPlane Mechanism Driver and L3 Service Plugin.
 - Configure the core Neutron components.
 - Manage the configuration of these resources in the neutron-openvswitch-cplane service.

Instruction for deploying the CPlane openstack bundle is as follows:
Note: This bundle will install some components of Openstack as well as CPlane charms.

    juju deploy cplane_openstack.yaml

# Configuration

 - ***cplane-controller_ip***: Configures the CPlane-controller node IP, but this value will be overwritten if a cplane-controller charm is deployed.
   
 - ***cplane-controller_port***: Configures the CPlane-controller node PORT, again this value will be overwritten if a cplane-controller charm is
   deployed.
