# Overview

The cplane-agent is a daemon that resides on compute nodes and other remotely managed endpoints. Cplane-agent is part of CPLANE NETWORKSâ€™ Distributed Control Software-Defined Networking infrastructure orchestration and management platform. Cplane-agent is an intelligent agent that supports autonomous functions, caching, threading, restart/recovery and provides a common north bound API for different services on the remote devices. Southbound, the cplane-agent
communicates with OpenVSwitch-cplane (OpenFlow, OVSDB), local Operation Systems, and other specialized local Daemons (e.g. Quaggad).
The cplane-agent communicates northbound to the CPLANE CONTROLLER and its applications and services.

CPLANE's software-only solution automates creation of WAN and LAN network services with a highly intelligent SDN platform. Through advanced discovery, modeling and service orchestration, CPLANE automates not only the low-level infrastructure configuration and management of data center and wide area networks, but also the higher-level, value-add functions such as network virtualization, routing, policy and QoS.   CPLANE delivers network services faster and more reliably on existing network infrastructure. Since CPLANE is a software-only solution with no vendor-specific dependencies, it offers the added advantage of providing a
path to new network architectures and technologies, and away from vendor lock-in.

# Usage

This charm is subordinate to the **nova-compute** charm.  It requires the deployment of the **cplane-controller** charm and **neutron-api-cplane** charm, which is again subordinate to the  **neutron-api** charm.   It eliminates the need for the neutron-gateway charm as L3 routing agent which is handled by the compute tier.

The neutron-openvswitch-cplane charm has several core functions:

 - Install cplane openvswitch Plugin.   
 - Install cp-agent   
 - Configure the core cp-agentd

Instruction for deploying the CPlane openstack bundle is as follows:
Note: This bundle will install some components of Openstack as well as CPlane charms.

    juju deploy cplane_openstack.yaml

# Configuration

 - ***mgmt-int***: Management interface for Cplane controller and the value
   will be overwritten if a cplane-controller charm is deployed.
 - ***cp-controller-mport***: Cplane controller multicast port, and the value
   will be overwritten if a cplane-controller charm is deployed.
 - ***cp-controller-uport***: Cplane controller unicast port, and the value
   will be overwritten if a cplane-controller charm is deployed.
 - ***openstack-controller-ip***: Configure the IP of the neutron-api-cplane node, but this value will be overwritten if a neutron-api-cplane charm is deployed.
 - ***cplane-controller-ip***: CPlane-Controller IP, but this value will be
   overwritten if a cplane-controller charm is deployed.
 - ***data-interface***: Data interface to create the bridge network
 - ***tun-interface***: Interface to create the br-tun bridge
 - ***fip-interface***: Interface to create the br-fip bridge
 - ***cp-agent-log-level***: Log level for CP agent dbg,info
